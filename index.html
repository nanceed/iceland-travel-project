      <h2>Why Reykjavik?</h2>
      <h3>A city of bold contrast</h3>
      <p>
        Reykjavík is the natural starting point for any visit to Iceland, and not undeservedly so. The capital is world-renowned
        for its culture, history, and natural beauty on all fronts.
        Reykjavík is a city of bold contrasts: it is both cosmopolitan and small-town; vibrant and sophisticated; young-at-heart
        and yet full of history. Many monuments, new and old, are also worth a peek, including the newly built oceanfront music
        and conference centre, Harpa.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pulsing beat of energy and lively events keeps Reykjavík alive and exciting and people are often surprised and
        impressed at how much culture, art and activities thrive in the city. But besides being world-renowned for it's vibrant
        culture, Reykjavík is truly the gateway to Iceland. The capital area has enough natural wonders at its doorstep to serve
        as a convenient base for exploring a great deal of spectacular landscape in several directions.
