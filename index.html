      <h2>Why Reykjavik?</h2>
      <h3>A city of bold contrast</h3>
      <p>
        Reykjavík is the natural starting point for any visit to Iceland, and not undeservedly so. The capital is world-renowned
        for its culture, history, and natural beauty on all fronts.
        Reykjavík is a city of bold contrasts: it is both cosmopolitan and small-town; vibrant and sophisticated; young-at-heart
        and yet full of history. Many monuments, new and old, are also worth a peek, including the newly built oceanfront music
        and conference centre, Harpa.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pulsing beat of energy and lively events keeps Reykjavík alive and exciting. People are often surprised and
        impressed at how much culture, art and activities thrive in the city. But besides being world-renowned for it's vibrant
        culture, Reykjavík is truly the gateway to Iceland.

            <p>
              Hallgrimskirkja is the largest church in the country, and towers over the centre of Reykjavik. The church is named after the
              17th-century clergyman Hallgrímur Pétursson, author of Hymns of the Passion. Its 73-metre-high tower
              provides a wonderful 360° view over all Reykjavik, the mountains around and the ocean streaching west to Greenland and
              the Americas. The tower is among the most visited site in Reykajavik.

            <p>
              Only a 15-minute drive from downtown Reykjavik, the Blue Lagoon is considered to be one of the most enjoyable and romantic spots in
              the country. The geothermal Blue Lagoon is famous for its ethereal milky-blue waters. Remaining at 102 degrees fahrenheit all year
              round, the waters are rich in silica and minerals. Soak in the lagoon, slather on a silica mud mask and enjoy the
              complimentary drink at the swim-up bar.
